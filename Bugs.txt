Dictionary grants attack and defense (should only grant attack) vs English * 
	FIX: equippable.py line 18
	Currently reads:
		self.english_defense_bonus = english_power_bonus
	Should read:
		self.english_defense_bonus = english_defense_bonus
	This should also fix Report Clipboards not granting English defense
	
	Also note:
	Though commented out, fighter.py line 25 should read:
		#self.english_defense = english_defense

Corpses render as black tiles when not in LOS (should render as floor tile).
